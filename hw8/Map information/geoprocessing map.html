    <h2>This map displays the distribution of fish species along the eno river using fish observation data collected by me on Inaturalist (This data is by no means suitable for specific scientific studies). I set out to compare distribution of different species across the man-made obstructions along the river (white dots). Observation data was overlayed along 200 meter river buffer, and data outside the buffer was removed using the "clip" method. areas of river colored light blue are areas of river that overlap with protected lands. I chose to create an interactive webmap so the Fish point layers could be interpreted much easier. It can be observed that the species composition differs between each of the obsruction sites, possibly owing to a lack of up-river transport methods for many species.
